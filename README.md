I use the head() and the info() method to view the obtained data sets both from the repository and the scrapped data.

region that has trhe highest sales records. Which turns out to be the west. This might be as a result of the high population density int he west
Office suplies also shows the highest shipmode quantity. Standard class shows highest sales redord with technology product toping the list of the standard class sales.
